## How and What to Post ##

**If you are having a problem with Tunnelblick, please:**

> If possible, use the latest "beta" version of Tunnelblick, which has additional logging that can help show the cause of problems.

  1. Make sure you do not have manually set DNS server addresses in OS X System Preferences : Network (select the primary interface, click the "Advanced..." button, then the DNS tab; there should be no addresses on the left that are not dimmed).
  1. Open the "VPN Detailsâ€¦" window.
  1. Select the configuration you want to connect in the list on the left.
  1. Make sure that "Set DNS/WINS" is set to "Set nameserver". (This is the default setting and will enable extra debugging and logging.)
  1. Click the "Advanced" button on the right; a new window will appear.
  1. Make sure that "Check if the apparent public IP address changed after connecting" is checked.
  1. Close the "Advanced" window.
  1. Click on the "Log" tab.
  1. Click on the "Connect" button.
  1. Wait until the problem occurs. **If the problem is that no connection is made, wait at least 70 seconds.**
  1. If you can, click on the "Disconnect" button and wait until the disconnection is complete. If the disconnection is not complete within 20 seconds, continue anyway.
  1. Click on the "Copy Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard" button.
  1. Close Tunnelblick.
  1. Paste into an email or web form.
