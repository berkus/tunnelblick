  * Changes many warning dialogs so they do not block other Tunnelblick operations.

  * Includes a new 'Inhibit automatic update checking and IP Address checking' checkbox on the 'Preferences' page. Checking it disables all Internet activity by the Tunnelblick program itself (but not by OpenVPN), overriding any other settings that allow such activity. The checkbox is unchecked by default.

  * Disables the 'Reset the primary interface after disconnecting' checkbox if 'Set DNS/WINS' is not set to 'Set nameserver'.

  * Includes changes to avoid compiler warnings on Xcode 5 and 6.

---


**3.4beta26 build 3828 (2014-05-02)**

  * Adds additional security checking of programs that Tunnelblick runs as root.

  * Moves the 'Copy Diagnostic Info to Clipboard' to the main part of the 'VPN Detailsâ€¦' window.

  * Adds a 'quit' command for AppleScript which terminates Tunnelblick properly so it is not launched at the next login.

  * When 'sanitizing' a configuration file for 'Examine OpenVPN Configuration File' and 'Copy Diagnostic Info to Clipboard', Tunnelblick strips lines that appear between lines that contain '-----BEGIN' and '-----END' (even in comments). (This strips certificates and keys created by Open Access.)

  * On OS X 10.6.8 and higher when using OpenVPN 2.3.3 and higher in a TUN configuration, Tunnelblick no longer automatically loads the tunnelblick tun kernel extension (kext). In this situation, OpenVPN will use the UTUN device driver built into OS X.

  * Warns user if the system clock is not set correctly.

  * Checks Tunnelblick preference files for errors.

  * Changes words for 'In:' and 'Out:' in Russian.

  * Shows a notification window for the most recently connected configuration upon mouseover of the Tunnelblick icon even if no configuration has been connected since Tunnelblick was launched.

  * On OS X 10.9 ('Mavericks'), forces the Tunnelblick icon to be in the standard status icon position (to the left of other icons at the time Tunnelblick is launched). This is a temporary limitation until a bug in OS X is fixed.

  * Allows non-ASCII characters (such as accented characters) in token names, passphrases, usernames, and passwords. (Available only in OpenVPN 2.3 and higher.)

  * Includes version 1.11 of pkcs11-helper.

  * Can use kill() to send SIGTERM to OpenVPN processes.

  * Reorders options to OpenVPN that are required by Tunnelblick so they cannot be overridden by entries in the configuration file.

  * Sets the 'IV\_GUI\_VER' environment variable when starting OpenVPN.

  * Adds a list of any unusual files in a .tblk to the diagnostic info.

  * Includes additional information in the Tunnelblick log if a script fails.

  * Displays 'OpenVPN is a registered trademark of OpenVPN Technologies, Inc.' on the Info panel.

  * Adds an entry to the Console Log if there are options in the configuration file that will be ignored because they are used by Tunnelblick or are incompatible with Tunnelblick.

  * Replaces embedded OpenSSL 1.0.1e with 1.0.1f (see [OpenSSL Vulnerabilities](http://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html)).

  * Checks and corrects ownership/permissions of launchd .plist files when Tunnelblick launches.

  * Adds a list of loaded non-Apple kexts to the 'Diagnostic Info'.

  * Adds detailed logging if the 'DB-ALL' preference is set.

  * Inhibits use of the default 'openvpn' domain if the per-configuration '-doNotUseDefaultDomain' preference is set.

  * Fixes a problem that caused the Tunnelblick icon to show the connection status incorrectly.

  * Fixes two problems that caused settings to change without the user requesting the change.

  * Fixes a problem with the Tunnelblick icon disappearing for five seconds after the computer wakes from sleep if Tunnelblick is not set to check for an apparent public IP address change.

  * Fixes a problem using Tunnelblick after the 'Examine OpenVPN Configuration' command is used.

  * Fixes a problem that caused the incorrect display of the 'Do not show on Tunnelblick menu' checkbox.

  * Fixes a problem recognizing OpenVPN processes that were running when Tunnelblick was launched.

  * Fixes a problem starting more than one configuration 'when computer starts'.

  * Fixes a problem disconnecting with the disconnect menu command or notification window disconnect button.

  * Fixes a problem disconnecting configurations set to start when the computer starts.

  * Fixes problems when Tunnelblick is launched when more than one configuration is already connecting or connected.

  * Fixes a problem that caused the 'VPN Detailsâ€¦' window to move to the center of the screen when the 'VPN Detailsâ€¦' menu command is clicked.

  * Fixes a problem reconnecting after computer sleep if 'Check if apparent public IP address changes after connecting' is not checked.

  * Fixes several minor memory leaks.


---


**3.4beta18 build 3704 (2013-12-18)**

  * Includes a new status icon (the icon in the menu bar) more in keeping with recent OS X aesthetics and which includes Retina images. (The old icon may be selected as the 'Tunnelblick 3.3 icon' on the Appearance panel of the 'VPN Detailsâ€¦' window.)

  * Changes to Tunnelblick's handling of computer sleep:
    * Adds a 'Disconnect when computer goes to sleep' checkbox on the 'Advanced' settings window; it is checked by default.
    * Before reconnecting any configurations after the computer wakes up from sleep, Tunnelblick waits for an Internet connection if checking that the IP address changed is allowed; or waits for a timeout period (the default is five seconds) if it is not.

  * Allows selection of the display on which notification windows will be shown if multiple displays are available.

  * Adds a 'Run MTU maximum size test after connecting' checkbox to the 'While Connected' tab of the 'Advanced' window.

  * Adds a button to obtain additional information when the user is asked if Tunnelblick should check for apparent public IP address changes. Clicking the button displays the new "Privacy and Security" wiki page.

  * Adds a symlink named 'default' to the Contents/Resources/openvpn' folder. The link points to the default OpenVPN binary, which is the lowest version of OpenVPN included in that copy of Tunnelblick. (Useful for scripts: they needn't search the 'openvpn' folder to find an OpenVPN binary.)

  * Fixes a problem converting some OpenVPN configurations to Tunnelblick VPN Configurations.


---


**3.4beta16 build 3679 (2013-11-22)**

  * Adds the 'Include anonymous profile information' checkbox to the Preferences panel.

  * Adds the 'Keep connected' checkbox to the Settings tab of Configurations panel. This will attempt to reconnect a configuration if OpenVPN crashes.

  * Allows the 'Place next to Spotlight icon' checkbox (on the Appearance panel) to be checked on OS X 10.9 ("Mavericks") with multiple displays if 'Displays have separate spaces' is unchecked in the Mission Control preferences. (Otherwise the checkbox may not be checked on Mavericks with multiple displays.)

  * Allows a 'preferences.plist' file in auto-install or .auto-install folders. Tunnelblick references specified in the file are set as specified when Tunnelblick is installed. (See https://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/cPkgs#Automatic_Installation for details.)

  * Checks for apparent IP address changes asynchronously.

  * Sets timer tolerances on Mavericks for lower power use.

  * Adds Tunnelblick settings and specific configuration settings to the info generated by 'Copy Diagnostic Info to Clipboard'.

  * Complains about OpenVPN options that cause writing to a file that is not specified with an absolute path.

  * Does not allow files larger than 10MB to be in Tunnelblick VPN Configurations.

  * Complains about files whose paths contain prohibited characters.

  * Increases the number of status windows allowed on the screen from 64 to 4096.

  * Fixes a problem with connection restarts (caused, for example, by the OpenVPN --ping-restart option) by not starting OpenVPN with the -up-restart option. The -up-restart option can be added to the configuration file if it is needed. Note: The OpenVPN configuration must not contain the 'persist-tun' option or restarts will still fail. (The OpenVPN documentation seems to be incorrect with respect to these two options.)

  * Fixes a problem that sometimes caused a crash when a configuration is deleted or Tunnelblick is started with no configurations.

  * Fixes a problem that sometimes caused a crash when an OpenVPN configuration file contains UTF-8 characters.

  * Fixes a problem that sometimes caused a crash during the installation of a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration if a file is empty.

  * Fixes a problem that sometimes caused a hang during a disconnection which encountered certain errors.

  * Fixes problems that sometimes caused Tunnelblick to refuse to install Tunnelblick VPN Configurations containing certain OpenVPN configuration file constructs or that contain files in subfolders.

  * Fixes a problem that caused Tunnelblick to sometimes ignore OpenVPN configurations.

  * Fixes a problem that caused unpredictable behavior if a free port could not be found for managing OpenVPN.

  * Fixes a problem that caused an unnecessary warning in the system log about an unknown preference.


---


**3.4beta14 build 3649 (2013-10-25)**

  * Implements 'Examine OpenVPN Configuration File' for Shared and Deployed configurations.

  * On OS X 10.6 ('Snow Leopard') and higher, allows the user to select multiple configurations in the VPN Detailsâ€¦ window and then change settings for all of the selected configurations. (A confirmation dialog prevents inadvertent changes.) The only setting that cannot be changed this way is the 'Connect' setting.

  * Adds per-configuration 'OpenVPN version' selection to the VPN Detailsâ€¦ window and removes 'OpenVPN version' selection from the Preferences panel.

  * Adds a per-configuration 'Check that the apparent IP address changed after connecting' checkbox to the Advanced settings window.

  * Replaces the 'Use Tunnelblick tun/tap drivers' checkbox on the Advanced settings window with pop-up buttons (one for tun and one for tap) that allow the user to always use the driver, never use the driver, or have Tunnelblick decide whether to use the driver based on the configuration file.

  * Adds a button on the Utilities panel that opens a web page with instructions for uninstalling Tunnelblick.

  * Moves 'Show configuration on Tunnelblick menu' to the Advanced settings window.

  * Fixes a problem when installing a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration that includes CR-LF sequences in the OpenVPN configuration file.

  * Fixes a problem with the appearance of the bottom of the configuration list in the VPN Detailsâ€¦ window.

  * Fixes a memory leak that would occur only under very unusual conditions.


---


**3.4beta12 build 3636 (2013-10-17)**

  * Logs more information if a sound is not found.

  * Fixes a problem on OS X 10.5 and 10.6 ('Leopard' and 'Snow Leopard') that caused incorrect 'invalid signature' warnings.

  * Fixes a problem on OS X 10.9 ('Mavericks') that caused Tunnelblick to crash when launched on some systems.

  * Fixes a problem on OS X 10.8 and 10.9 ('Mountain Lion' and 'Mavericks') with 'Copy Diagnostic Info to Clipboard'.

  * Fixes a problem that causes the log to 'freeze' under certain circumstances.

  * Fixes a problem when user-supplied scripts output a lot of text to stdout or stderr.

  * Fixes an error in the Italian (IT) localization.


---


**3.4beta10 build 3614 (2013-10-05)**

  * Includes additional security checking when Tunnelblick is launched:
    * Verifies the digital signature of the Sparkle framework.
    * Verifies that kexts and digital signatures are secured.
    * Verifies that everything in the application is writable only by root.
    * Checks that the system folders used by Tunnelblick are secure.

  * Includes better error checking and reporting when installing a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration.

  * Option-click (Alt-click) on most configuration settings checkboxes allows the choice of changing the setting for the selected configuration or for all configurations.

  * Includes a new per-configuration preference, '-openvpnVersion' which can contain an OpenVPN version string (for example, '2.3.2'). A value of '-' will use the latest version of OpenVPN. If set, it will override the application-wide 'openvpnVersion' preference. (This preference cannot yet be set by the GUI.)

  * Includes the ability to use an asterisk ("`*`") in front of the name of a connection-specific preference to indicate that all configurations should use that preference by default. (A specific preference for a configuration will override this default.)

  * Includes a new TBAlwaysSetPreference key to Info.plist of a .tblk. It is used like TBPreference, but it causes the preference to be set 'always' -- it is reset each time the configuration is connected and when Tunnelblick starts up.

  * Recovers more gracefully from OpenVPN crashes.

  * Includes better help on the 'Advanced' settings page.

  * Fixes a problem that caused settings on the 'While Connected' tab of the 'Advanced' window to be ignored.

  * Fixes a problem with the release of a DHCP lease on a TAP connection when using the 'Set name server' DNS/WINS setting.

  * Fixes a problem that did not allow .crl files in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk).

  * Fixes several problems that caused failures when installing a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration.


---


**3.4beta08 build 3576 (2013-09-06)**

  * Fixes a problem that caused update checks to fail.


---


**3.4beta06 build 3571 (2013-09-06)**

  * Fixes a crash when accessing checkboxes on the 'Advanced' window.

  * Uses digitally signed tun and tap kexts on OS X 10.9 ('Mavericks').

  * Recovers more gracefully from some crashes.

  * Fixes a typo in the ES (Spanish) translation.

  * Fixes a problem that sometimes caused a spurious entry in the Console Log.

  * Fixes a small memory leak.


---


**3.4beta04 build 3555 (2013-08-21)**

  * Uses https: for update checks and loading all update information. (Updates are still protected by being digitally signed; this is an additional level of security.)

  * Uses https: for IP address checks that use a domain name in the URL to test DNS. Tunnelblick continues to use http: for IP address checks that use an IP address in the URL, which is done if the first IP address check (using a domain name in the URL) fails. This is done because https: requires a domain name, not an IP address. There is no information sent out that is encrypted, and the received data for this request is discarded, so encryption is not necessary, anyway.

  * Adds a 'Check for updates to beta versions' checkbox in the 'Updates' section of the 'Preferences' panel, which controls the new 'updateCheckBetas' preference. If checked, Tunnelblick will check for new beta versions of Tunnelblick that are available for update, otherwise, Tunnelblick will check for new stable versions. Checked by default when running a beta version, unchecked by default when running a stable version.

> Note: This feature may be used to revert to the latest stable version from a later beta version: if this is un-checked in a beta version, Tunnelblick will offer to install the latest stable version, which may be a 'downgrade' from the beta version to an earlier stable version.

  * Uses new URLs when checking for updates:
    * 'https://www.tunnelblick.net/appcast-s.rss' to check for new stable versions,
> > > and
    * 'https://www.tunnelblick.net/appcast-b.rss' to check for new beta versions.


> The URL of customized or Deployed versions of Tunnelblick that contain a non-standard update feed URL have '-s' or '-b' appended to the last component of the URL before the extension (e.g. 'http://aaa/bbb/ccc.ddd' becomes 'http://aaa/bbb/ccc-s.ddd' or 'http://aaa/bbb/ccc-b.ddd' to check for stable and beta versions, respectively).

  * Updates several Dutch (NL) translations; a Italian (IT) translation, and a Chinese (simplified) translation.

  * Fixes spacing problems on the 'Preferences' tab that occur when there is only one version of OpenPVN included in Tunnelblick.
