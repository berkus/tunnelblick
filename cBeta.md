A **"beta"** version of a program is a version that has been tested internally and is ready for testing by the wider community. It usually has new features that are subject to change and need testing, and may have bugs or limitations.

Beta versions of Tunnelblick are usually quite stable; a major difference between a beta and a stable version is that beta versions are not fully translated to all of the languages in stable versions.

**PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK** about beta releases in the [Tunnelblick Discussion Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tunnelblick-discuss).

When a new beta version is available, it is announced to the [Tunnelblick Announcement Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tunnelblick-announce).

Shortly after a new beta version is availble, it will be available as an automatic update from older beta versions.

Beta versions (if any) are available on the [DownloadsEntry?tm=2 Downloads] page.
