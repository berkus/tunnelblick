**Localizing and Translating Tunnelblick**

> <font color='red'><b>Translators are needed for Arabic, Chinese (traditional), Japanese, and Korean.</b> <a href='cLocalizeTranslate.md'>Details</a></font>

  * The _new_ way of localizing the Tunnelblick application is described on this page.

  * Localizing the names of configurations and other content that can be added to Tunnelblick is described in [Other Localization](cLocalizeConfigurations.md).

  * Comments about specific strings used in Tunnelblick are on the [Translation Notes](cTranslationNotes.md) page.

  * The _old_ way of localizing is described in [Localizing Tunnelblick](cLocalize.md) and [Translating .strings Files](cTranslateStrings.md).



&lt;hr&gt;


**The _new_ Way**
  * Tunnelblick is localized on [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com/project/tunnelblick), a translation management site that provides free service for open source projects such as Tunnelblick. Crowdin does not do the actual translations; it only provides the infrastructure in which translators can work and a way of managing those translators.

  * For Tunnelblick, localization consists solely of translating strings. No graphic manipulation or spacing or moving of text is required.

  * All translation work is done in a specialized translation editor in your browser.

  * <font color='red'>To join the localization team, please email project owner jkbullard at gmail.</font>*** You can help a little or a lot, all help is welcome!
    * Everyone who makes a meaningful contribution will be credited on Tunnelblick's [Thanks page](cThanks.md) and on the "Info" panel of the application itself.**

  * See [Using Crowdin](cUsingCrowdin.md) for specific procedures that the Tunnelblick Crowdin project uses to sign up for and use Crowdin.
