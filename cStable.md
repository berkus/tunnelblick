A stable release is a version that has been tested as thoroughly as possible and is as reliable as we can make it. It usually does not have all the new features of a [beta release](cBeta.md), but may be more reliable.

All available releases may be found on the [Downloads page](DownloadsEntry.md).

Cumulative [Release Notes](RlsNotes.md) describe changes for all versions.
