These downloads have been contributed by users and usually help deal with special circumstances.

These scripts unload the Cisco AnyConnect tun kext before a Tunnelblick connection is started, and reload the Cisco tun kext after a Tunnelblick connection is stopped. (The Cisco kext interferes with Tunnelblick's operation of tun connections.) Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher.</li></ul>

These scripts mount a volume after a configuration is connected and unmount it when the configuration is disconnected. Scripts must be edited before use (in any plain-text editor) to specify details of the volume to be connected. Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher. For a note about connecting to a CIFS account, see <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion'><a href='https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion'>https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion</a></a>.</li></ul>

These scripts  provide a mechanism for the user to be alerted when the VPN has been up for more than 20 minutes or when bandwidth has exceeded 100MB. See <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tunnelblick-discuss/7lGWKR1-rC4/OGHhCfmrXfgJ'>this post</a> on the Tunnelblick Discussion Group for details. Requires Growl. Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher. <strong><font color='red'>Includes compiled binaries; use at your own risk.</font></strong>

<blockquote><h2>Verifying Downloads</h2>
Verifying downloads is a good idea. Even though the .dmg format and the application's OS X digital signature provide some protection, you can also compare the SHA1 checksum and the MD5 hash of your downloaded file with the official published ones.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To compute the checksum and hash of a file you've downloaded, type the following into /Applications/Utilities/Terminal:<br>
<blockquote>openssl sha1 <i>path-to-the-file</i>
</blockquote>and<br>
<blockquote>openssl md5 <i>path-to-the-file</i></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>The SHA1 checksum and the MD5 hash of current Tunnelblick binaries are shown above, under the link to the binaries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For older binaries hosted on SourceForge, go to<br>
<blockquote><a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/tunnelblick/files/All%20files'>https://sourceforge.net/projects/tunnelblick/files/All files</a>
</blockquote>and find the file in the list. Click on the little "information" icon (the white "i" in a dark circle) to the right of the file's name in the line. The SHA1 checksum and MD5 hash of the file will be displayed along with some other information.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Note: There are two files for each download, an X.dmg and an X-updater.dmg. The files are identical. Downloads from Tunnelblick's Google Code website use X.dmg and updates from within the Tunnelblick application use X-updater.dmg.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>For even older binaries hosted on Google Code, the SHA1 checksum is shown on the page with the download.</blockquote>
