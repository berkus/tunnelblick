Tunnelblick is "just" a GUI -- a front end for OpenVPN. Each Tunnelblick VPN Configuration includes an OpenVPN configuration file (a file with an extension of .ovpn or .conf) that Tunnelblick tells OpenVPN to use to make a connection. The details of how OpenVPN should connect using the configuration are contained in that file.

OpenVPN files are plain-text files that contain the instructions for OpenVPN to connect a client to a server or run a server. There are dozens of options for these files. The primary documentation for them is the [OpenVPN 2.2 man page](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/427-openvpn-22.html).

There is also a [list of OpenVPN documentation](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation.html).

There are also many tutorials about setting up OpenVPN available on the web, just search for "openvpn configuration", "openvpn tutorial" or "openvpn tutorial os x".
